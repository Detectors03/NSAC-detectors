# Hazard-detectors
# Hazard-detectors is a ML based web-app which detects the hazards of different kinds like cyclone,forest fire etc. through satellite as well as actual images.
# The user just need to select image from local storage and upload it. The api sends the image to model for prediction and model returns the predicted output and displays it on the user's display.

# The front of the web-application made completely using HTML/CSS and Javascript
